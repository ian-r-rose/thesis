\begin{abstract}
Rotating planets are most stable when spinning around their maximum moment of inertia, 
and will tend to reorient themselves to do so. 
Geological activity redistributes mass in the planet, making the moment of inertia a function of time.
As the moment of inertia of the planet changes, the spin axis shifts with respect to
a mantle reference frame in order to maintain rotational stability.
This process is known as true polar wander (TPW). 
Of the processes that contribute to a planet's the moment of inertia,
convection in the mantle generates the largest and longest-period
fluctuations, with corresponding shifts in the spin axis.
True polar wander has been hypothesized to explain several geographic features on planets and moons in our solar system.
On Earth, TPW events have been invoked in some interpretations of paleomagnetic data.
Large swings in the spin axis could have enormous ramifications for paleogeograhpy,
paleoclimate, and the history of life.

Although the existence of TPW is well-verified, it is not known whether its rate and
magnitude have been large enough for it to be an important process in Earth history.
If true polar wander has been sluggish compared to plate tectonic speeds, 
then it would be difficult to detect and its consequences minor.
Herein we investigate rates of true polar wander on convecting planets using scaling, numerics,
and inverse problems.

We perform a scaling analysis of TPW on a convecting planet, identifying a minimal
set of nondimensional parameters which describe the problem. The primary nondimensional numbers
that control the rate of TPW are the ratio of centrifugal to gravitational forces ($m$)
and the Rayleigh number ($\mathrm{Ra}$). The parameter $m$ sets the size of the rotational bulge,
which determines the amount of work that needs to be done to move the spin axis.
The Rayleigh number controls the size, distribution, and rate of change of
moment of inertia anomalies, all of which affect the rate of TPW.
We find that the characteristic size of moment of inertia anomalies decreases with
higher $Ra$, but that the characteristic response time for TPW also decreases.
These two effects approximately cancel. However, the orientation of the principal axes of
the moment of inertia becomes less stable to perturbations at high $\mathrm{Ra}$, thereby increasing the rate of TPW.
Overall, we find that a more vigorously convecting planet (one with a higher $\mathrm{Ra}$)
is more likely to experience large TPW events.

Flow induced by density anomalies in the mantle deflects free surfaces at the surface
and the CMB, and the mass anomalies due to these deflections contribute to the moment of inertia.
A full accounting of the moment of inertia anomalies must include these surface effects.
Numerical models of mantle convection with a free surface have suffered from numerical
sloshing instabilities. We analyze the sloshing instability by constructing a generalized
eigenvalue problem for the relaxation time spectrum. The minimum relaxation time of the spectrum sets the
maximum stable timestep. This analysis gives the first quantitative explanation for
why existing techniques for stabilizing geodynamic simulations with a free surface work. 
We also use this perspective to construct an alternative stabilization scheme based
on nonstandard finite differences. This scheme has a single parameter, 
given by an estimate of the minimum relaxation time, and allows for still larger timesteps.

Finally, we develop a new method for analyzing apparent the polar wander (APW) paths
described by tracks of paleomagnetic poles. Existing techniques, such as spline fits
and running means, do not fully account for the uncertainties in the position
and timing of paleomagnetic pole paths. Furthermore, they impose regularization
on the solution, and the resulting uncertainties are difficult to interpret.
Our technique is an extension of paleomagnetic Euler pole (PEP) analyisis.
We invert for finite Euler pole rotations that can reproduce APW paths
within a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo framework. This allows us
to naturally include uncertainties in age and position, and provides error estimates
on the resulting model parameters. Regularization can be accomplished via
physically motivated choices for the parameters' prior probability distribtions.

We applied our Bayesian PEP technique to the Mesoproterozoic Laurentian APW track,
which primarily comes from the Keweenawan Midcontinent Rift zone. We fit
the track with one and two Euler rotations. Both inversions did a good job
of reproducing the Keweenawan track, though the two Euler pole inversion
has a closer fit. We find that the implied Laurentian plate speeds exceeds
22.9 cm/yr at the 95\% confidence level. These speeds are significantly faster than
Cenozoic plate speeds, and could be explained by either faster plate speeds in
the Proterozoic or a TPW event.
